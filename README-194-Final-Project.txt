Final Project

To run Snap! simple click on index.html
However, sometimes running a file locally isn't very good due to security
protocols, so you should so the following:
cd snap/ [or wherever this directory is]
python -m SimpleHTTPServer [for Python 2]
or
python -m http.server [for Python 3]
then go to: http://localhost:8000/
and play around!

But be careful, the Graphics stuff is fragile!
