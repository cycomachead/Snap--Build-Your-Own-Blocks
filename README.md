### [Run Snap<i>!</i> now!][run]

## Getting Started With Snap<i>!</i>
To start using Snap<i>!</i> we recommend you just jump in! There is also a very handy [manual][manual] available.

To get started with development, you should take a look at the [contributing][contrib] file, though it is currently a bit out of date.  Each file in the Snap<i>!</i> source is well documented with comments and a beginning introduction. You may also find [this discussion][overview] helpful. If you are interested in fixing a particular issue, feel free to comment on that thread.

Snap<i>!</i> is currently available in **26** different languages! If you'd like to help translate Snap<i>!</i> to a new language, or improve an existing translation, please take a look at the [translations guide][translation].

## Getting In Touch
There are a few main places the Snap<i>!</i> team hangs around.

* The [Github Issues Tracker][gh-issues] is used for bugs, and support questions. If you have encountered a bug, please search here to see if others have had similar experiences.
* There is a user-centered [discussion thread][user-thread] on the Scratch forums.
* There is also a [development thread][dev-thread] on the forums.
